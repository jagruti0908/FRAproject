# FRA Atlas & WebGIS DSS ‚Äì Frontend  

This project is a **front-end implementation** of an AI-powered **Forest Rights Act (FRA) Atlas** and **WebGIS Decision Support System (DSS)**. It is designed to monitor, visualize, and support the implementation of the **Forest Rights Act, 2006** in India with an emphasis on **transparency, accountability, and accessibility**.

## üåç Project Overview  

The application serves as a **digital platform** for:  
- Centralizing and digitizing FRA claim records  
- Providing an interactive WebGIS dashboard with maps and analytics  
- Offering decision support tools for authorities  
- Enabling transparency and progress tracking for communities  

The system uses **dummy backend data** (placeholders) for demonstration and can be integrated with actual APIs and datasets later.
